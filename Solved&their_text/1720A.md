# This is the solution to the problem 1720A on Codeforces

## My idea was to divide the problem into 3 possible scenarios
### 1st is if a/b=c/d then return is 0
### 2nd is if ad/bc is an intiger value then return is 1
### 3rd is everything else and return is 2
#### the reason behind this is the fact that just by multiplying both denominators by 1. b by (ad) and d by (bc) you get equal fractions
P.S if any of the numbers is 0 return is always 1
## Here is the code:
n=int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print("Enter four integers that represnt",i,". pair of fractions")
    a=int(input())
    b=int(input())
    c=int(input())
    d=int(input())
    if a==0 or b==0 or c==0 or d==0:
        print("1")
    elif (a/b)==(c/d):
        print("0")
    elif ((a/b)/(c/d)==int((a/b)/(c/d))or(c/d)/(a/b)==int((c/d)/(a/b))):
        print("1")
    else:
        print("2")
