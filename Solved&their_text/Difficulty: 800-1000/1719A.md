# This is the solution to the problem 1719A on Codeforces

## My idea was to divide the problem into 2 possible scenarios
 First scenario is that m and n (sides of the board) are either both odd or both even and after a bit of thinking it is easy to tell that the return is always the: 
 2nd person
 Second scenario is that m and n are different ( one is odd and the other equal) and there the winner/return is always the:
 1st person
The explanation behind it is quite long but a hint to make it simpler is to only look at one type of movement first becaue it doesn't matter if the person moves right then up  alternately or fully to the one side  
so just try to solve right movements first then upper movement and keep in mind that the size of the side isnt important just its pairity.
## Here is the code:
```.py
m=int(input())
n=int(input())
if m%2==n%2:
  print("2nd person")
else:
  print("1st person")
  ```
